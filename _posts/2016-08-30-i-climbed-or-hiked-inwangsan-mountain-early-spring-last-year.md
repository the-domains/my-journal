I climbed or hiked Inwangsan Mountain early spring last year with my colleagues. It was part of our outing activity to see historical sites especially those related with people who fights for human freedom.

Anyway, we took off from Sodaemun area and walked all the way to the foot of Inwangsan, which is actually located in Seoul area. And it was a nice walk and not far from our office.

We past by the walls on our way up and could see a few traditional Korean houses and more of modern apartment and taller buildings becoming more obviously invading the spacious areas of the old Seoul.

As you start climbing up the lower part of the mountain, you'll notice shorter level of walls which I think the old walls that the government, through tourism department, try to restore physically and bring back into memory its ancient stories, if not, just the feel of it.

Of course, I can imagine how people in the past crisscrossed that same road and mountain paths with their cows, heavy loads and everything they could carry on their way either to the markets or back home.

Brief Descriptions of Inwangsan Mountain (인왕산, 서울))

Close to Inwangsan (Inwang Mountain) you can find ritual sites of King Sejo and some castle walls that stretch from Sajik Tunnel to Jahamun.

Inwangsan Mountain is more than 300 meters high and tops over Honghae District, Sodaemungu, Muakdong, Nusangdong, Ogindong and Buamdong in Jongno-gu.

The mountain's name literally means "mountain of a generous king" in Korean language. This mountain approximately covers about 1 million square meters. Just like most mountains in Korea, this mountain is mostly composed of granite elements.

You can obviously observe the granite boulders showing off at the sides and piling up on top of this mountain.  
These granite boulds have various and interesting shapes and forms. Normally, Koreans, just like most humans throughout the world would do, associate some shapes to images and create meanings in them.  
For example, there are granite rocks that they call train rock (kicha bawi), skirt rock (chima bawi), hat rock (moha bawi), among hundreds of shapes and forms that one can associate and create meaning with.  
That makes hiking this mountain an interesting experience aside from the nice view of Seoul and the surrounding districts.

#### **Artists, Fortress, and Kings**

Inwangsan is popular not only among its hikers who can have a great view of Seoul and its surrounding districts, but since time immemorial. Famous painters depict this mountain in their paintings where you can find in many museums established in Seoul.  
For example, the famous painter Jeong Seon who painted "Inwang jesaekdo" (translated as "After the rain at Mount Inwang"). The painting was painted during the reign of King Yeongjo of Joseon Dynasty in 1751\. You can find this great painting at Ho-Am Art Museum in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province.

In addition, the Fortress Walls of Seoul envelops Inwang Mountain where you can also find the tourist sites--Inwangsa (Inwang Temple) and Guksadang Shrine. Most temples attract foreign visitors, like myself, due to various reasons such as its sense of tranquility, divine presence... you can add more!  
Guksadang is a shamanist shrine. This shrine houses the spirits of Joseon Dynasty's King Taejo and other generals. Guksadang was first built in Namsan Mountain (in 1395) but got destroyed during the war in 1925 and restored where it is located now.  
So, there is so much to see in this popular mountain, although honestly I've haven't yet explored all of them. That would be part of my update then for this page!  
Thanks for reading through and hope you'll visit this blog more often to discover more about this mountain and anything interesting about Seoul and South Korea in general.  
Have a great day!
