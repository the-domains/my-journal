It is the least visited among Seoul's Five Grand Palaces, nevertheless it is a pretty and peaceful place worth your visit. During the Joseon Period, this palace has been used as secondary palace for the kings. Being located on the western part of Seoul, this was also known as 'seogwol' or the 'palace of the west.' It is only in times of danger and emergency that a king would use this as his secondary place of refuge or shelter.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/99f87ee4-a8ee-4742-8de5-3f997c5fe8a1.jpg" alt="Main hall of Gyeonghuigung"><p>There were about ten kings of Joseon Dynasty who took shelter at this very place, from King Injo to King Cheoljong. During the Japanese occupation, Gyeonghuigung Palace was burnt down and a school for Japanese students was built on top of it.</p><p>In the 1990s the Korean government took the initiative to reconstruct the 'Five Grand Palaces' located in Seoul area. For various reasons, it was said that only around 30 percent of this palace was rebuilt.</p><p>Gyeonghuigung was completed in the 12th year of Gwanghaegun's reign in 1620. The completed palace was composed of more than 100 halls but most got burnt down during the two separate fires, during the reign of King Sunjo in 1829 and during the reign of King Gojong. The remaining halls were destroyed during the Japanese occupation and where a Japanese school was built on the same ground instead.</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/57db0865-bca5-4e7e-9a11-b6311f843be1.jpg" alt="Sideview of Gyeonghuigung Palace"><p>When Korea was liberated in 1946, Seoul High School was built on this ground and has been used until 1978.</p><p>Since in 1985, many structures in the palace have been reconstructed including the Sungjeongjeon Hall, where you can find the thrones of the king and the queen.</p><h3>Heunghwamun Gate (흥화문)</h3><p>Personally, I like this gate because it looks grand and splendid. It has a high roof which is similar in style to most gates in Korea. I specially like its round and huge wooden columns that support the heavy weight of the whole roof.</p><p>Heunghwamun is the main gate of Gyeonghuigung Palace and where you can directly see the present buildings and structures of the palace's ground. The original site of this gate is just next to the Salvation Army Center facing Jongno avenue. During the road expansion in 1915, Heunghwamun was sold and planted as main of Bakmunsa (a temple) where the present Shilla Hotel is situated.

The five weights with matching italics make Open Sans extremely versatile and useful for a wide range of applications. It is a ubiquitous font on the web, used by everyone from Google to WordPress. I’ve even heard it referred to as the “flat design” font. I like to think of Open Sans as the new Arial."}},"styles":"html { font-family: '-apple-system', '.SFNSText-Regular', 'San Francisco', 'Roboto', 'Segoe UI', 'Helvetica Neue', 'Lucida Grande',
